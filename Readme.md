##  Solutions & Implementation

### Problem 1: Fix "Add New Notice" Page

**Issue:**  
When clicking 'Save', the description field was not being saved to the database.

**Solution & Steps:**
1. **Reviewed the Notice Form**  
   - Inspected `add-notice-page.tsx` and `notice-form.tsx` to ensure the `description` input was properly included and controlled by React Hook Form.
2. **Traced API Payload**  
   - Verified the POST payload from the frontend contained the correct `description` field.
3. **Checked Backend Integration**  
   - Followed the flow through the backend controller (`notices-controller.js`), service, and repository/database to ensure the description was passed and stored correctly.
4. **Fixed Mapping Issues**  
   - Resolved any discrepancies between the frontend field names and backend/database columns.
5. **Validated End-to-End**  
   - Added a new notice via the UI and confirmed the description was saved and displayed correctly in the notice list.

**Result:**  
The "Add Notice" feature now saves and displays the description field as expected.

### Problem 2: Complete CRUD Operation in Student Management Page

**Requirement:**  
Implement all CRUD handlers in `students-controller.js` for student management.

**Solution & Steps:**
1. **Implemented Controller Methods**  
   - Filled out all required handlers in `students-controller.js`:
     - `handleGetAllStudents`
     - `handleAddStudent`
     - `handleUpdateStudent`
     - `handleGetStudentDetail`
     - `handleStudentStatus`
2. **Connected to Service Layer**  
   - Mapped each controller to its corresponding service method for business logic.
3. **Ensured Data Integrity**  
   - Populated the database with reference data (e.g., `classes`, `sections`) so all required fields in the student form had valid dropdown options.
4. **Resolved Form/Field Issues**  
   - Debugged and fixed issues related to missing required dropdowns or invalid input (e.g., ensuring Roll is numeric, section is selected).
5. **Tested Full CRUD Flow**  
   - Used the frontend UI to add, view, update, and change the status of students.
   - Verified backend responses and data changes in the database.
6. **Error Handling**  
   - Ensured meaningful error messages for validation and backend issues.

**Result:**  
Student CRUD operations are fully functional—students can be created, listed, updated, and have their status changed through the UI and backend.

##  Testing & Validation

- **UI:** All features tested via the frontend forms and lists.
- **API:** Verified correct request/response cycles through browser Network tab and backend logs.
- **Database:** Confirmed data consistency with direct SQL queries.
